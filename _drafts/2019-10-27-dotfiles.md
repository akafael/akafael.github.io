In Linux almost every configuration is stored as a plan text file. One nice trick is to store all config files inside a Git repository and place at config folder only a symlink to the original file. This enable use the whole git power to keep track of your very own configurations.

## Dotfiles Repository 101

Create a repository directory at home folder
```
cd 
mkdir .dotfiles
git init
```

Create a folder inside your repository and move original config file to repository
```
mkdir -p ~/.dofiles/myApp/
mv ~/.config/myApp/config ~/.dofiles/myApp/config
```

Add it to your repository
```
cd ~/.dofiles/
git add ~/.config/myApp/config
git commit -m "Add myApp config"
```

Add a symbolic link from repository
```
ln -s ~/.dofiles/myApp/config ~/.config/myApp/config
```

And that is it! You can add as much config files as you need.
