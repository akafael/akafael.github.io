Model Driven Design

## Definition

Mathematical Model is a description of system using mathematical concepts and language. The same could be applied to programming.

## Functional Programming

Model can store properties, not only raw data.

## Model as Protocol

Model is carrier that enable exchange between two systems. Whenever a communication lawer between two systems is created, the information is encoded in a common definition following some model. 

## Data Management

Fat models combining all data related are expensive. One approach to solve this issue is to split the model in multiple other. This allows to split the model into chuncks.

Converter. Whenever a system gets bigger is require to create some way to translate the information inside one model to another. 

Multiple models can be combined into bigger ones.

## Digital Twin

The underlining idea of a digital twin is combine multiple model to evaluate properties from real world.
